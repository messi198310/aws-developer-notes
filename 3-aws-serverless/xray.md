X-RAY

With X-Ray, you can understand how your application and its underlying services are performing to identify and troubleshoot the root cause of performance issues and errors.

Segments - The compute resources running your application logic send data about their work as segments. A segment provides the resourceâ€™s name, details about the request, and details about the work done. e.g. host, request, response, start and end times.

Sampling - To ensure efficient tracing and provide a representative sample of the requests that your application serves, the X-Ray SDK applies a sampling algorithm to determine which requests get traced.
